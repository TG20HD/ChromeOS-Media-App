# ChromeOS Media App
The ChromeOS' built-in media app ripped with some modifications to BARELY work

What works:
- Video playback
- Website layout.

What doesn't work:
- Image, audio, and PDF viewing.
- Using the buttons or CTRL+O to open files. Must drag-and-drop.
- No mobile support (buttons don't work so that's a given)

<h1>Note for the wise:</h1>
If you use this for any reason other than private use (Private use is just having it saved, examples of not private use is having publicly available edited versions of this online, hosting this on a website, fixing stuff and sharing it online, etc.), 
you must credit me on the webpage and on any pages that you link downloads. 
A simple "Original rip by TG20", followed by a link to my Github or this repository will do. 
You must also make the code open source. 
The easiest way to do this is to fork this repository and make your changes. Thanks, and have fun!
